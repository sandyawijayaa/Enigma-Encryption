# Enigma-Encryption
Class project from CS61B: Data Structures, taken in Spring 2022. 

This project involves building a simulator for a generalized version of the Enigma, an encryption machine that Germany used during World War II to encrypt its military communications. It takes in descriptions of possible initial configurations of the machine and messages to encode or decode.
